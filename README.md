# AI-TensorFlow.js
It is most simple AI Neural Network by TensorFlow in JavaScript language with few codes and components.

All of TensorFlow.js examples and demoes in the web are complicated and confusing, But this project is consist of compact few codes especially at its core, "model.js" file which make it easy to understanding.

Complicated full project with visual environment is available in my another repository at:
https://github.com/marzban2030/TensorFlow.js-vis

Because of hardware resource limits in most common systems such as GPU texture size limit to running webGL, I put below code lines in "model.js" file inorder to reducing GPU hardware resource usage by shortening training and testing data tensors to under 10% of their length:

const Xtrain = tf.tensor4d(data.trainImages.slice(0, 3920000), [5000, 28, 28, 1]);

const Ytrain = tf.tensor2d(data.trainLabels.slice(0, 50000), [5000, 10]);

const Xtest = tf.tensor4d(data.testImages.slice(0, 784000), [1000, 28, 28, 1]);

const Ytest = tf.tensor2d(data.testLabels.slice(0, 10000), [1000, 10]);

If your system hardwares are very strong you can change above codes in "model.js" file to below codes inorder to running with full length of training and testing data tensors:

const Xtrain = tf.tensor4d(data.trainImages, [55000, 28, 28, 1]);

const Ytrain = tf.tensor2d(data.trainLabels, [55000, 10]);

const Xtest = tf.tensor4d(data.testImages, [10000, 28, 28, 1]);

const Ytest = tf.tensor2d(data.testLabels, [10000, 10]);

After successful run you will see something like as this. It will take about 3 minutes to be completed:

Run above script once time to creating Neural Network Model and saveing it to browser local storage permanently, Then everytime that you want to predicting handwritten digits from your drawing with mouse or finger touch on screen, Navigate your browser to this URL:

Increase epochs number in the "model.js" file for more accuracy, Live demo:

Also to taking maximum accuracy you can run at full length of training and testing data tensors, But it need hours time and very strong hardwares to be completed.
